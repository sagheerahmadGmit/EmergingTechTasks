    "#### Task: Calculate a square root to 100 decimal places\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the ways we can calculate the square root of a number is by using Newton's Method.[1,2,3]. Newton's Method uses a specific formula, seen below, to calculate the square root. It is known an an iterative method and approximates roots of equations. The algorithm starts off by guessing the square root of the given number as x > 0. It then computes a more accurate guess by taking the derivative of f(x) to get f'(x) and plug it into the formula. We then repeat the formula until we get a better and more accurate guess. The problem that I encountered with this formula was that it does not print out the value to 100 decimal places. It prints out the first 52 values and the rest are left as Zeros.\n",

    "\n",
    "<br /> <br />\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula shown below first calculats the square root of two to one hundred decimal places and prints it out. But when it was printed out the value was a big number with no decimal places. In order to add a decimal place the number had to be converted into a list and the . could be inserted then. The list is then joined together and printed out as a string."
