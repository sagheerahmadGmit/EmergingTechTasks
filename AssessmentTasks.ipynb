    "#### Task 1: Calculate a square root to 100 decimal places\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the ways we can calculate the square root of a number is by using Newton's Method.[1,2,3]. Newton's Method uses a specific formula, seen below, to calculate the square root. It is known an an iterative method and approximates roots of equations. The algorithm starts off by guessing the square root of the given number as x > 0. It then computes a more accurate guess by taking the derivative of f(x) to get f'(x) and plug it into the formula. We then repeat the formula until we get a better and more accurate guess. The problem that I encountered with this formula was that it does not print out the value to 100 decimal places. It prints out the first 52 values and the rest are left as Zeros.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br />\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ z_{next} = z - \\frac{z^2 -x}{2z} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "<br /> <br />\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula shown below is another way of calculating the the square root of 2. The first thing the method is doing is setting the x value from the user to, x multiplied by 10 to the power of 200. This will take all the numbers from the right side of the decimal place and brings it to the left side. The method has 2 other variables, one is a variable used in the while loop while the other is a googol. The while loop keeps running until an accurate guess is made. Inside the while loop we are setting b to z and then calculating a better guess for z. The guess is using floor devision because we do not want any decimal places in the answer. The guess is also being bitshifted to the right, the bitshifting shifts the bits of the first operand right by the specified number of bits.[6] Once the guess is accurate the while loop stops and prints out the value. I first had it so the program prints the value z staright away but this was a problem because when it was printed out, the value was a big number with no decimal places. In order to add a decimal place the number had to be converted into a list and the . could be inserted then. The list is then joined together and printed out as a string.\n",

I next use the scipy.stats library to figure out the Expected value, the p value, the actual chi square value and the degree of freedom. This is done by using the chi2.contigency function that is built in the scipy.stats library. This function takes in a variable. So I created a variable and populated it with the table data and used that in the function. The \" stats.chi2_contingency(data)\" then returns 4 different values, which are, the chi squared value, the p value, the degrees of freedom and the expected frequencies. This method returns all those values based on the marginal sums under the assumption of independence. The assumptions are:\n",
