    "#### Task: Calculate a square root to 100 decimal places\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the Oxford Dictionary a square root is a \"a number which produces a specified quantity when multiplied by itself\". There are many ways to determine the the square root of a number. I will be discussing one of these methods and then trying to code a program that will be able to get the square root of a specified number and print it out to 100 decimal places.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the ways we can calculate the square root of a number is by using Newton's Method.[1,2,3]. Newton's Method uses a specific formula, seen below, to calculate the square root. It is known an an iterative method and approximates roots of equations. The algorithm starts off by guessing the square root of the given number as x > 0. It then computes a more accurate guess by taking the derivative of f(x) to get f'(x) and plug it into the formula. We then repeat the formula until we get a better and more accurate guess. \n",
