# Emerging Technology


Introduction
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This Jupyter Notebook contains the tasks for the module "Emerging Technology" in 4th year Software Development Course. It is written in the Python programming language. It will contain the programs for the four different tasks that we will be given.

The first task is: 

``` 
Write a Python function called sqrt2 that calculates and
prints to the screen the square root of 2 to 100 decimal places. Your code should
not depend on any module from the standard library1 or otherwise.
```
The second task is :

```
The Chi-squared test for independence is a statistical
hypothesis test like a t-test. It is used to analyse whether two categorical variables
are independent. The Wikipedia article gives the table below as an example [4],
stating the Chi-squared value based on it is approximately 24.6. Use scipy.stats
to verify this value and calculate the associated p value. You should include a short
note with references justifying your analysis in a markdown cell.
```

The third task is: 

```
The standard deviation of an array of numbers x is calculated using numpy as np.sqrt(np.sum((x - np.mean(x))**2)/len(x)). 
However, Microsoft Excel has two different versions of the standard deviation calculation, STDDEV.P and STDDEV.S . 
The STDDEV.P function performs the above calculation but in the STDDEV.S calculation the division is by len(x)-1 
rather than len(x) . Research these Excel functions, writing a note in a Markdown cell about the difference between 
them. Then use numpy to perform a simulation demonstrating that the STDDEV.S calculation is a better estimate for 
the standard deviation of a population when performed on a sample. Note that part of this task is to figure out 
the terminology in the previous sentence.
```


Task One
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#### Task: Calculate the square root of 2 to one hundred decimal places
---------------------------------------------------------------------

According to the Oxford Dictionary a square root is a "a number which produces a specified quantity when multiplied by itself". All real numbers have two square roots, One positive and one negative. All square roots are written with the âˆš symbol. There are many ways to determine the the square root of a number. I will be discussing one of these methods and then trying to code a program that will be able to get the square root of a specified number and print it out to 100 decimal places.

One of the ways we can calculate the square root of a number is by using Newton's Method.[1,2,3]. Newton's Method uses a specific formula, seen below, to calculate the square root. It is known an an iterative method and approximates roots of equations. The algorithm starts off by guessing the square root of the given number as x > 0. It then computes a more accurate guess by taking the derivative of f(x) to get f'(x) and plug it into the formula. We then repeat the formula until we get a better and more accurate guess. The problem that I encountered with this formula was that it does not print out the value to 100 decimal places. It prints out the first 52 values and the rest are left as Zeros.

The formula shown below is another way of calculating the the square root of 2. The first thing the method is doing is setting the x value from the user to, x multiplied by 10 to the power of 200. This will take all the numbers from the right side of the decimal place and brings it to the left side. The method has 2 other variables, one is a variable used in the while loop while the other is a googol. The while loop keeps running until an accurate guess is made. Inside the while loop we are setting b to z and then calculating a better guess for z. The guess is using floor devision because we do not want any decimal places in the answer. The guess is also being bitshifted to the right, the bitshifting shifts the bits of the first operand right by the specified number of bits.[6] Once the guess is accurate the while loop stops and prints out the value. I first had it so the program prints the value z staright away but this was a problem because when it was printed out, the value was a big number with no decimal places. In order to add a decimal place the number had to be converted into a list and the . could be inserted then. The list is then joined together and printed out as a string.


Task Two
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Task: Use scipy.stats to verify this value and calculate the associated p value
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Chi-squared test for independence is a statistical hypothesis test like a t-test. It is used to analyse whether two categorical variables are independent. The Wikipedia article in the research section, gives the table below as an example [1],
stating the Chi-squared value based on it is approximately 24.6. <br>

|             | A   | B   | C   | D   | Total  |
| ----------- | ----| ----| ----| ----|--------|
| White collar| 90  | 60  | 104 | 95  | 349    |
| Blue collar | 30  | 50  | 51  | 20  | 151    |
| No collar   | 30  | 40  | 45  | 35  | 150    |
| Total       | 150 | 150 | 200 | 150 | 650    |

<br><br>

The chi squared tests are used to check if there is a statistical difference between the expected and observed frequencies in a contigency table. It tests the association between the two criteria of association.  

I originally had the code that it would use the panda library to create a dataframe using the the relevant values and output the result. The table that was printed was very similar to the one shown above. The table and the values were saved in a variable called "data", which woud be used later by the scipy.stats library. I then realised that I was only allowed to use the scipy.stats library to perform the required calculations. I decided to change the code a little bit to better fit the requirements. I did this by creating a variable and adding the dataset from the table into it. The dataset was saved row by row: 

```
#data to be inserted into the columns
data = [[90,60,104,95], [30,50,51,20],[30,40,45,35]]
```

The data is then used to get the four values printed out by the stats.chi2_contingency(data) method. These four values are the chi squared values, the p value, the degrees of freedom and the expected frequencies. These values were then printed out and the chi squared value printed was the same as the one we were trying to verify.

```
chi2, p, dof, ex = stats.chi2_contingency(data)
```

The values that are printed are: 

```
The approximate chi squared value is: 24.6 

The associated p value is: 0.0004098425861096696 

The Degree of Freedom is: 6 

The expected frequencies are: 
 [[ 80.53846154  80.53846154 107.38461538  80.53846154]
 [ 34.84615385  34.84615385  46.46153846  34.84615385]
 [ 34.61538462  34.61538462  46.15384615  34.61538462]] 
 ```
 
The chi squared value has been rounded to one decimal place. It was originally, 24.5712028585826.

The library that was used for this task was te scipy.stats. This library contains a large number of probability distributions as well as a growing library of statistical functions.[6] The P value probability of obtaining test results at least as extreme as the results actually observed, under the assumption that the null hypothesis is correct. If the p value is greater than 0.05 that means the null hypothesis is true and if the value is less than or equal to 0.05 than the hypothesis should be rejected.[7]

The code and results verify that the values are correct.


Task Three
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Task: Research the excel functions and use numpy to perform a simulation demonstrating that the STDEV.S calculation is a better estimate for the standard deviation of a population when performed on a sample.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
When dealing with statistical data it is evident that there are two data sets that can be used to get the standard deviation. There are population and sample data sets. In this task I will try to differenciate between the two and try to explain why STDDEV.S calculation is a better estimate for the standard deviation of a population when performed on a sample.

Firstly lets get the defenition of both of them: [1]

A population is:

```
A population is the entire group that you want to draw conclusions about.
```

While a sample is: 

```
A sample is the specific group that you will collect data from. The size of the sample is
always less than the total size of the population.
```

It is always a good idea to know what data set to use when getting the standard deviation. As we already know there is only one difference between the two formulas. The population data set uses the formula:  
  
```np.sqrt(np.sum((x - np.mean(x)) ** 2)/len(x))```

while the sample data set uses the formula:  

```np.sqrt(np.sum((x - np.mean(x)) ** 2)/len(x)) -1```

The syntax for using the population sample data is "STDEV.P(number1,number2,...)". The syntax for for the sample data is very similar but the p is replaced by a s, "STDEV.S(number1,number2,...)".[3][4].

There is a slight difference in the population and sample dataset. This can be seen in the code cell. The small difference in the answers allows the sample data to get a better mathematical estimate of the population. It statistically gives a better estimate than population due to it working with only a small sample than the entire population.
